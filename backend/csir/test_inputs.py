We present a benchmark targeting a novel class of systems: se-

on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators,
configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via
LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multi-
